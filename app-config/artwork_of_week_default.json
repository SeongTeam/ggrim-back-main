It is an excellent example of Cézanne's skilled, detailed and innovative mature work from 1880 onwards.Cézanne painted four oil portraits of this Italian boy in a red vest (waistcoat in British English), all in different poses, which allowed him to study the relationship between the figure and space. The most famous of the four, and the work commonly referred to by this title, depicts a boy in a brooding seated pose with his elbows resting on a table and his head in his hands. This work is currently housed in Zurich, Switzerland. Three other portraits in different poses are held in museums in the United States.",

In addition, he had to endure criticism and criticism from critics and the public who did not understand Cézanne's original techniques at the time. Cézanne's friend wrote in a letter to Émile Zola (1840-1902), `Cézanne's paintings have been on display for a long time. 'If it had happened, people would have broken the windows and destroyed the canvas, he recalled. Cézanne, who was sensitive and lacked patience, experienced deep skepticism and frustration, but fortunately, colleagues such as Émile Zola and Camille Pissarro (1830-1903) provided him with comfort.",

For the remainder of his career he returned to the motif of Mont Sainte-Victoire, resulting in an incredibly diverse series of works. They show the mountains from different perspectives, often in relation to other constantly changing elements (trees and bushes in the foreground, buildings and bridges, fields and quarries). From this series we can extract more than 20 paintings and a subgroup of watercolors.",
